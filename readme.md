# SGAN-Fuzz: A Deep Learning-based MQTT Fuzzing method using Generative Adversarial Networks

SGAN-Fuzz is a fuzzing tool that uses Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to generate sequences of MQTT messages that can be used to test the robustness of MQTT brokers and clients. The tool is designed to help developers and security researchers identify vulnerabilities and weaknesses in MQTT implementations.

## Features
- Uses GANs to generate realistic MQTT message sequences
- Supports multiple message types and parameters
- Allows users to configure message sequence length and batch size
- Provides visualization tools to help users analyze generated message sequences

## Dependencies
- Python >= 3.6
- TensorFlow >= 2.0
- Eclipse Mosquitto (for testing)

## Getting Started
To use SGAN-Fuzz, first install the required dependencies and clone the repository. Next, configure the tool by setting the desired message sequence length, batch size, and other parameters. Finally, run the tool to generate MQTT message sequences, which can be used to test MQTT brokers and clients.
